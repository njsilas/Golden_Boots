# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#Team.create([{name: "Flying Dutchmen", id: 3}, {name: "Dutch National Team", id:4}, {name: "1998 TOTY", id: 5}])

#Player.create(team_id: 4, name: "Robert Van Percy", pos: "ST", nat: "Dutch")
