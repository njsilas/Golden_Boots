# Golden_Boots


Golden Boots is a single page rendering Javascript application that logs 
data for your next upcoming trip. 

## Installation

Clone the repository at https://github.com/njsilas/golden_boots.
Once you have finished that. Run bundle install within the backend directory,
then run rails db:migrate and rails db:seed. After this step, open frontend in 
your console and type in open index.html.

## Usage
This application was designed for you to input your top starting 11 soccer players
of all time by position. Golden Boots allows you to create your team and view other
users teams. Once the user creates a team upon initialization, they will have the ability
to input a player based off their position. The user can view other teams as they create
their team. After a player is created in their position, the user will have the ability to
delete a player and create a new one. 

## Support
Please reach out to njsilas@gmail.com if you are experiencing any issues

## Roadmap
I have enjoyed creating Golden Boots. I am currently running my application on a 
2-D css field. I am in the process of converting this to a 3-D field.
